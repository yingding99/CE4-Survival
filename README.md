# CE4-Survival
A multiple-testing-based simultaneous inference procedure to identify subgroups from RCTs with survival outcomes

Motivated by analyzing the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) data, a large RCT
to study the efficacy of nutritional supplements in delaying the progression of an eye disease,
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we develop a simultaneous inference procedure to
identify and infer subgroups with differential treatment efficacy in RCTs with survival outcome.
Specifically, we formulate the multiple testing problem through contrasts and construct their
simultaneous confidence intervals, which control both within- and across- marker multiplicity
appropriately. The method has been applied to AREDS to assess
the efficacy of antioxidants and zinc combination in delaying AMD progression. Detailed results can be found at arXiv:2003.10528.

This simultaneous inference approach provides a step forward to confidently identify and infer subgroups in modern drug development.
